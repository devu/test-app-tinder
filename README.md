# AppTestTinder

This time the actual test :)
I didn't really have time to set up nice animation for draggable cards and instead images there are placeholders but the rest is according to spec.

I've used Redux to serve initial portion of data.
Forced myself to implement my own mechanic instead relying on ready to go components.

```
> npm install
> npm start
```
